This folder contains the input climate data files used to run HydroTrend (in Ganga and Brahmaputra folders)

This folder also contains two notebooks:
- brahma_climatedata.ipynb
- ganges_climatedata.ipynb

These notebooks are used to visualize the climate data from the rcp4.5 and rcp8.5 climate scenarios, concatenated to the reference scenario, to see how the climate data provided by each climate model varies. It is also used to evaluate the predicted changes in temperature and precipitation over the coming century by each climate model. Finally, mean daily and mean annual temperature and precipitations are plotted.
